# Subtitle-Translator-using-ZhipuAI
This Python script translates SRT (SubRip Subtitle) files from a source language to a target language using the ZhipuAI large language model (LLM). It reads an SRT file, extracts the text content, translates it using the glm-4-flash model from ZhipuAI, and then generates a new SRT file with the original and translated text.
